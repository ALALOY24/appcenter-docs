# App Center Product Roadmap

> [!NOTE]
> We're updating our roadmap on an almost daily basis now and directly involving our customers in the product planning process. So we've **moved our product roadmap** to the [App Center GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/appcenter). Read below to learn more, or just jump into the repo to see what our plans are.

To more actively engage with our customers, we've moved our public roadmap to the [App Center GitHub repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/appcenter). In our new roadmap, you’ll see a list of planned enhancements to existing services, plus new services we’re planning or thinking of adding.

Each feature exists as an issue in the repository, linked to the iteration plan(s) where we reference the feature. For feature changes that have a user interface (UI), we’ll also publish mock-ups of our proposed UI. There’s no guarantee that everything will make it into App Center, but you’ll know how we’re thinking.

Your comments on the Iteration Plan and Features create an open dialog between us and customers. This change lets others see the feedback you share.

- Got a feature request and don’t know what to do with it? Add it as a feature to the repository. 
- Like to change how a feature works? Let us know. 
- See someone else’s feature or comment that looks interesting? Give it a Thumbs Up or a +1 so we know you agree. Be sure to search the existing issues first before adding a new one to help us avoid duplicates.

The GitHub repository isn't where you'll get [product support](https://docs.microsoft.com/appcenter/help). When you have issues, problems, or questions about App Center and how App Center works; use the 'Contact support' option under the help menu in the upper right corner of App Center portal. Our support team is there to answer your questions and help you solve your problems.
