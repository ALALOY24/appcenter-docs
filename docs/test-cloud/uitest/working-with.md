# Working with Xamarin.UITest

The documents in this section discuss various task for writing and running Xamarin.UITests.

## [Android signing](working-with-android-signing.md)

Normally the default Xamarin.UITest Android signing, using a generated debug keystore, works fine. But, sometimes you may need to sign your APK and the test server with your actual Android keystore. This guide describes when it may be needed and how to specify your Android keystore information.

## [Backdoors](working-with-backdoors.md)

*Backdoors* are methods that can be invoked during a test run to perform some special action to configure or set up testing state on a device. For example, a backdoor may be used to seed a database with some test data so that all of the tests in a given fixture have the same data.
