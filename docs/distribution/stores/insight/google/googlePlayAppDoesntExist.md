# Why do I see `App package has no match in Google Play Console.`?

The package you entered could not be found in your Google Play Console account.
Log into your Google Play Console account and [make sure your app is published.](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/ "Published apps")

**How can I fix it?**

* You can publish your app on any track (alpha, beta, or production). Once your app is published in at least one track, App Center will be able to release and upgrade your app for any track.
* If you donâ€™t know what is you package name, you can find it inside the **manifest.json** file.

    Example:\
    `package="com.example.myapplication"`

    [Read more in Googles documentation](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/ "Published apps") or by running the `aadt` command against your .apk file, example shown below:

    `$ ./aapt dump badging myapplication.apk`

    Result:\
    `package: name='com.example.myapplication'`
