# Push to User

Along with sending notifications to devices directly or via Audiences, App Center Push enables customers to send notification messages to all of the devices associated with one or more users. 

Since App Center supports setting user identity two different ways (using the SDK or using the App Center Auth service), the approach an app takes to send a notification to one or more users varies depending on how App Center obtained the target user's identity.
