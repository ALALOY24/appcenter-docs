## Disable all services at runtime

If you want to disable all App Center services at once, use the `setEnabled()` API. When disabled, the SDK will not forward any information to App Center.

```javascript
await AppCenter.setEnabled(false);
```

To enable all services at once again, use the same API but pass `true` as a parameter.

```javascript
await AppCenter.setEnabled(true);
```

## Change state of service in runtime

You can enable or disable desired service at the runtime with following code:

```javascript
await AppCenter.Analytics.setEnabled(false);
```

> [!NOTE]
> This method should only be used after AppCenter is started.

## Check if App Center is enabled

You can also check if App Center is enabled or not.

```javascript
const enabled = await AppCenter.isEnabled();
```

## Identify installations

The App Center SDK creates a UUID for each device once the app is installed. This identifier remains the same for a device when the app is updated and a new one is generated only when the app is re-installed or the user manually deletes all app data. The following API is useful for debugging purposes.

```javascript
var success = function(installId) {
    console.log("Install ID: " + installId);
}

var error = function(error) {
    console.error(error);
}
AppCenter.getInstallId(success, error);
```

## Identify users

The App Center SDK supports setting a **user ID** that is used to augment crash reports. To use this capability:

1. Configure the App Center SDK as described in the [App Center SDK Getting started guide](~/sdk/getting-started/cordova.md).
2. Set a `userID` in the SDK using the following code:

```javascript
AppCenter.setUserId("your-user-id");
```
After setting a user ID, you can use App Center's search feature to search for specific crash reports associated with the ID. Learn more in App Center's [search documentation](~/diagnostics/search.md). 

> [!NOTE]
> Note that the value for the user id is limited to 256 characters.
