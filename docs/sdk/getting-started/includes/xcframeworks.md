> [!NOTE]
> App Center SDK supports the use of `xcframework`. If you want to integrate xcframeworks into your project, download the **AppCenter-SDK-Apple.xcframeworks.zip** and unzip it. This folder does not contain different platforms' subfolders, instead it contains a set of xcframeworks. They can be integrated the same way as usual frameworks.
