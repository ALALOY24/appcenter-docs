The `app_secret` is an identifier of your app. The biggest risk of exposing your `app_secret` is sending bad/unrelated crashes and analytics data to your app, as the app secret is required to know which app the traffic applies to. 
It will have no effect on the security of the data. To retrieve any sensitive data, you would need to provide an app/user token [App Center API tokens and documentation](../../api-docs/index.md), which is generated on the clientâ€™s side.
However, there is no way to make any data that must be placed on the client's side completely secure. One of the ways to increase the security of your application is injecting the `app_secret` into your code via an environment variable so that it is not visible in the code.
