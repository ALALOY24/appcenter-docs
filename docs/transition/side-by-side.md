# HockeyApp data on App Center

All your HockeyApp apps are automatically available in App Center. All your HockeyApp distribution groups are available in App Center. All releases that have been distributed through HockeyApp are also visible in App Center.

Uploading new releases can be done in either HockeyApp or App Center and is synchronized. Legacy distribution groups are automatically created in App Center. These legacy groups are synchronized with HockeyApp. Any release to a legacy distribution group is uploaded to HockeyApp and testers are notified via HockeyApp.

## Getting Started with your HockeyApp data in App Center

As a HockeyApp customer, your apps and account information automatically synchronizes and are ready for you in App Center. Getting started is easy:

1. [Sign-in to App Center](https://appcenter.ms/login?utm_medium=referral_link&utm_source=Hockey%20App) with your HockeyApp Credentials
2. Once logged in, you'll see a list of all of your existing HockeyApp apps. HockeyApp apps are marked with a blue HockeyApp icon.

## Limitations

While you can work in both services, settings for your HockeyApp apps are only editable in HockeyApp. The following app management tasks can only be edited in HockeyApp:

* Managing app collaborators and testers.
* Managing organization owners.
* Editing app settings such as the app name, and its public or private access status.Â 
* Managing notification settings.

> [!TIP]
> Move your apps to remove the synchronization and get full control in App Center.
