# Move multiple apps at once via API

Moving apps one by one can be a challenge when you have to do it for many apps. The following APIs enable you to move multiple apps at once for your user or organization account.

Please note: Your apps might use features or functionality that is not available in App Center. Make sure you read about potential [compatibility issues](~/transition/moving/incompatibilities.md). Once you've moved an app, only a [subset of HockeyApp APIs](~/transition/api.md) remains functional. Make sure you update those unavailable to the new App Center API. Also, understand what [data](~/transition/moving/data.md) will be moved for your apps.

## Move apps owned by a user account
Specify a list of app IDs or move all apps of your user account via `POST /api/2/apps/move`. 

Parameters:

* **apps** - Array of app IDs. No app ID specified requests to move all apps of the account.

Example:
```curl \
    -X POST \
    -F "apps[]=69e641a599f64e4c8adbb221b05a5ab1" \
    -F "apps[]=096dea13e6244155b0a7733328dcff57" \
    -H "X-HockeyAppToken: 182a66de22s040l591s014645b9d7c87" \
    https://rink.hockeyapp.net/api/2/apps/move
```

Return:
```Status: 200
Body:
{
    "url":"https://rink.hockeyapp.net/confirm_moving_apps/5?confirmation_token=beadef8a-6c05-4837-8b4b-acc7b9539ed1"
}
```

Open the returned url in your browser and confirm to move the apps.

## Move apps owned by an organization account
Specify a list of app IDs or move all apps of an organization via `POST /api/2/organizations/<org-id>/apps/move`. You have to be owner of the organization to move apps.

Parameters:

* **apps** - Array of app IDs. No app ID specified requests to move all apps of the account.

Example:
```curl \
-X POST \
-F "apps[]=096dea13e6244155b0a7733328dcff57" \
-F "apps[]=69e641a599f64e4c8adbb221b05a5ab1" \
-H "X-HockeyAppToken: 182a66de22s040l591s014645b9d7c87" \
https://rink.hockeyapp.net/api/2/organizations/3407707/apps/move
```

```Status: 200
Body:
{
    "url":"https://rink.hockeyapp.net/confirm_moving_apps/6?confirmation_token=8bf7e14b-b813-473f-9b07-0aae28528e1e"
