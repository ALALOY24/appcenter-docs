# Moving apps from HockeyApp to App Center

Any HockeyApp app can move to App Center. In App Center, you'll move an app from HockeyApp to App Center from the App Center App's Overview. Apps can be moved by owner or the owners of the organization owning the app. If an app was created in HockeyApp is indicated with a little HockeyApp icon behind the app title in the list of apps.

> [!NOTE]
> After you moved an app it still receives data from the HockeySDK in App Center from past releases. In-app updates also remain functional.

Not all features or functionality is supported on App Center in the same way as on HockeyApp. Find out more about the compatibilities and what data is being moved:
