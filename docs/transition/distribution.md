# Distributing Releases

You can distribute new releases in both App Center and HockeyApp for your HockeyApp apps.

## Distributing Groups

On App Center, distribution groups exist on an app or on an organization level. On HockeyApp, all distribution groups exist globally and are owned by a user or an organization. **Distribution groups owned by a user or distribution groups that have a different owner than the app aren't supported on App Center.** To keep the global syncing functionality of distribution groups, we recommend to transfer all app and distribution groups to the same organization before moving apps.
