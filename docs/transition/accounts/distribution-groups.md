# Shared Distribution Groups from HockeyApp

Distribution groups owned by an organization that were created in HockeyApp can now be managed in App Center. Shared distribution groups for user accounts aren't supported in App Center.

> [!NOTE]
> To retain the share functionality of your distribution groups across apps on App Center make sure the distribution groups assigned to an app are owned by the same organization as the app. [Read more](~/transition/moving/incompatibilities.md#distribution-groups) about the limitation.

## Testers
The testers of a HockeyApp distribution group owned by an organization are now managed in App Center.

## Apps
Apps in a distribution group that were moved to or created in App Center are controlled in App Center. HockeyApp apps that haven't been moved are controlled in HockeyApp. Move the apps to fully manage them as part of a shared distribution group in App Center.
