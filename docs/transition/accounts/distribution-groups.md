# Shared Distribution Groups from HockeyApp

Distribution groups that were created in HockeyApp are now equal to App Center distribution groups. In App Center, shared distribution groups from HockeyApp are only available to organizations. App Center does not support shared distribution groups for user accounts. The testers of a HockeyApp distribution group owned by an organization are managed in App Center now. Apps that were moved to or created in App Center are managed in App Center as well now. HockeyApp apps that haven't been moved can be controlled only in HockeyApp. Move the apps to fully manage them as part of a shared distribution group in App Center.

> [!NOTE]
> To retain the share functionality of your distribution groups across apps on App Center make sure the distribution groups assigned to an app are owned by the same organization as the app. [Read more](~/transition/moving/incompatibilities.md#distribution-groups) about the limitation.
