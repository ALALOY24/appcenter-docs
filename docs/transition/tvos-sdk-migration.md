# Migrate from the HockeySDK to App Center SDK

[!include[](sdk-migration-dropdown.md)]

App Center doesn't support this platform yet. Continue to use the HockeySDK for now. You can look at [our roadmap](https://github.com/Microsoft/appcenter/wiki/Roadmap) to stay up to date on it.

## Contact us

In case you have any questions or feedback related to the SDK migration, contact us via support by clicking on the blue icon in App Center portal or leaving us a note in the docs itself.
