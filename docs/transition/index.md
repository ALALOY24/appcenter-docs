# HockeyApp

Apps that were migrated from HockeyApp still receive data from the HockeySDK.

## Migrate from the HockeySDK to the App Center SDK

Follow this documentation to update your apps to use the App Center SDK instead of the HockeySDK. The guides for each platform are listed below.

* [HockeySDK Android](android-sdk-migration.md)
* [HockeySDK iOS](ios-sdk-migration.md)
* [HockeySDK UWP](uwp-sdk-migration.md)
* [HockeySDK macOS](macos-sdk-migration.md)
* [HockeySDK tvOS](tvos-sdk-migration.md)
* [HockeySDK Xamarin](xamarin-sdk-migration.md)
* [HockeySDK Unity](unity-sdk-migration.md)
* [HockeySDK Cordova](cordova-sdk-migration.md)
* [HockeySDK WPF/Winforms](wpf-winforms-sdk-migration.md)
