# Analytics

App Center Analytics gives you insights about your users and their actions in the app. By taking advantage of our side by side experience, you can see all your Analytics data not only in HockeyApp, but also in App Center.

## What's new about App Center Analytics with respect to HockeyApp

App Center Analytics provides an improved experience with respect to HockeyApp. Apart from the Analytics information that you are already getting in HockeyApp, you will also get information about:

- Session Duration
- Devices
- Languages
- Incoming logs in real time (log flow)

Once you are ready to make the move to App Center, you will also get information about the countries where your users are located.

App Center also provides more metrics about your custom events such as count per user and count per session, as well as the ability to delete individual events.

Check out the [App Center Analytics docs](~/analytics/index.md) to learn more about our Analytics offering.

## HockeyApp Bridge App and Export

As a HockeyApp user, you might have used or heard of the HockeyApp bridge app, which allows you to export your Analytics data from HockeyApp to Application Insights.

App Center Analytics offers the same functionality, with an easier set up experience. On top of that, you can also export your Analytics and Crash data into Blob Storage. Learn more about [Analytics Data Export](~/analytics/export.md).
